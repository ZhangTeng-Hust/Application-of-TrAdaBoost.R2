# Application-of-TrAdaBoost.R2
## Description：
This repository is the source code of the paper "A transfer learning based geometric position-driven machine error prediction method for different working conditions", which is mainly used to predict the machining error value under different working conditions,
The link to the article is as follows: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357671252_A_transfer_learning_based_geometric_position-driven_machining_error_prediction_method_for_different_working_conditions
