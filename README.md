# Application-of-TrAdaBoost.R2
## Description：
This repository is the source code of the paper "A transfer learning based geometric position-driven machine error prediction method for different working conditions", which is mainly used to predict the machining error value under different working conditions

## Gratitude
The writer provides the reference of the original code for this work, https://github.com/jay15summer/Two-stage-TrAdaboost.R2，
Twostagetradaboost.py was built by the author，Thank you very much.
